The first fintech for women with a focus on entrepreneurship and community.
===
We are creating a product environment where women can not only do business and make purchases, but also communicate with each other, create joint companies, build communities, and support social projects.
Our product considers the behavioral specifics of women as consumers and entrepreneurs, and helps them solve daily tasks.

Mission: Build a global community of a hundred million female entrepreneurs
**Insight:**
Men and women use money differently, that's why we are building a fintech focused on the financial behaviors of women.
===
We have noticed that women are the most underestimated clients by fintech companies. Despite being 51% of the population - they are more disciplined and financially literate clients. Women statistically have fewer defaults and are more active in small business.
47% of Micro-Small Businesses are owned by Women.
===
For us, it is obvious that women today constitute an independent and cool audience for whom a special product can and should be developed. And we decided that fintech with socialization features would be the ideal environment for economically and socially active women.
